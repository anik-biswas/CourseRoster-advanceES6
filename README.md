<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->

# Project Features

   1. Cards loaded from json data (fake data created with required information)
   2. Every card has a select button , after select this card course name and credits  are showing in sidebar .
   3. Toast message showing for selected course and remaining credits.

 
 
 # Managing the state of project 
   
  -Using useEffect for fetch the data from json and set data in useState.
  - useState is a built-in hook in React that allows you to add and manage state within a functional component. 
  - For this I use UseState for Total cost, Total credit and remaining credit to handle and set  this data.
